        <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh pasta</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 oignon</li>
            <li>600 grs of chopped meat</li>
            <li>cream</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>mozarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step by step</h2>
        <p>First, you will have to do a blognese sauce. It will take you 30 minutes.<br>
           Then, get into the Bechamel sauce by blending and cooking and everything the cream and the milk together. You know.
           Once it is done, you will have to carefully add the layers in a plat as follow.
        </p>
        To begin with, <em><strong>the secret</strong></em> is to add a layer of butter and oil at the bottom of the plate so it won't stick. Then you're all <set class=""></set>
        <ol>
            <li>A layer of pasta</li>
            <li>A layer of bechamel</li>
            <li>A layer of bolognese</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Keep going until the top by ending with a layer of bolognese.
           And the final touch: The cheese on the bolognaise 5 minutes before the end of cooking.
