        <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh pasta</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 oignon</li>
            <li>600 grs of chopped meat</li>
            <li>cream</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>mozarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step by step</h2>
        <p>First, you will have to do a blognese sauce. It will take you 30 minutes so get on with it.<br>
           Then, get into the Bechamel sauce by blending and cooking the cream and the milk together. You know.<br>
           Once it is done, you will have to carefully add the layers in a very specific order.
        </p>
        To begin with, know that <em><strong>the secret</strong></em> is to add a layer of butter and oil at the bottom of the plate so it won't stick. Then you're all set:
        <ol>
            <li>A layer of pasta</li>
            <li>A layer of bechamel</li>
            <li>A layer of bolognese</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Keep going until the top by ending with a layer of bolognese.
           And the final touch: The cheese on the bolognaise 5 minutes before the end of cooking.
        </p>
        <p><b><i>ENJOY!</i></b> and good luck</p>
